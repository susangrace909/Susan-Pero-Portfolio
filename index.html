    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      Hello! My name is Susan Pero and I am from Orlando, Florida. I grew up in
      a musical household and originally went to school to study music
      education. I taught elementary music, but chose to change gears and follow
      my passion for plants. Once I completed my degrees in Plant Science I
      began to work as head grower for a local cactus nursery. I loved what I
      did, but knew that such a physical career would not be sustainable. While
      working in those fields I dabbled in coding and even did some free
      bootcamps, so I chose to look into making it my career. I am currently
      attending UCF's Coding Bootcamp with hopes of a job upon completion.
