## User Story

- As an employer, I want to view a potention employee's developed portfolio of work samples so that I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position.

## Acceptance Criteria

- When I load their portfolio, I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar of them, their work, and how to contact them.

- When I click one of the links in the navigation, the UI scrolls to the corresponding section.

- When I click on the link to the section about their work, the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications.

- When I am presented with the developer's first application, that application's image should be larger in size than the others.

- When I click on the images of the applications, I am taken to that deployed application.

- When I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices, I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport.
